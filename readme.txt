III. BOTTLENECKS:
-----
Dates:

(2/20)
So far not many problems have arisen that haven't been able to be handled. We had a bit of a set-back with chat logging, figuring out the logins, and the server randomly crashing, but nothing too out of hand. Onward and upwards!

(2/27)
The due date is set, March 8th! We have figured out image sharing and are working on video/audio sharing. To handle the login process we might have to switch to Facebook API, but all in all its a working product!

(3/8)
It is the final day. The application is practically finished except for a few minor tweaks with the chat and login. We're giving it all we got!
